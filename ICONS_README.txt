ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

The extension requires three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tool.
The extension will work without icons (Chrome will use a default icon),
but it's recommended to add custom icons for a professional look.

Suggested icon design:
- Airplane symbol
- Flight-related imagery
- Use the extension's color scheme (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)

To create icons:
1. Design a 128x128 icon
2. Resize to 48x48 and 16x16
3. Save as PNG files with the names above
4. Place in the extracter folder
